# Project Plan Context

This project is a benchmark experiment comparing three robot data collection methods (phone teleop, leader teleop, hand-guided) across three manipulation tasks. You can find the high-level plan for the project in @.cursor/rules/project-plan/plan.md , when making decisions or suggestions, ensure they align with the experimental design and hypotheses outlined in the plan.
